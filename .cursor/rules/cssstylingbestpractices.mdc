Title: CSS / Styling Best Practices

Content:
When generating or editing CSS (or CSS-in-JS), follow these rules:

1. Consistency
- Keep naming conventions consistent (e.g. BEM-ish or simple flat class names).
- Use one color notation (e.g. hex or HSL) across the project.
- Use consistent indentation and one property per line.

2. Structure
- Organize styles into LOGICAL SECTIONS:
  - General / base styles (body, headings, lists, table basics)
  - Utilities (e.g. .no-bullets, .flex-center)
  - Layout / sitewide (header, nav, main layout)
  - Feature-specific or component-specific styles
- Prefer class selectors over deeply nested selectors.

3. Maintainability
- Comment non-obvious CSS, hacks or browser workarounds.
- Avoid overly specific selectors that are hard to reuse.
- Prefer reusable utility classes instead of duplicating rules.
