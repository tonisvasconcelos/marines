Prefer modern ES modules, const/let, arrow functions, and template literals.

Do not mutate function arguments or shared state. Use immutable patterns (map, filter, reduce, spread/cloning).

Handle all async code with async/await and proper try/catch, avoid unhandled promise rejections.

Validate and sanitize external input (query params, body payloads, headers) before using it.

Use strict equality (===) and avoid type-coercion surprises.

When adding utilities, place them in a shared utilities/helpers module instead of scattering them across components.
