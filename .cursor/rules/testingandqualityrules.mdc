When adding or changing behavior, prefer to add or update tests (unit/integration) if the project already includes a testing framework.

Cover critical paths: authentication, tenant filters, permissions checks, and main business rules.

Run existing tests and linting before concluding changes. Fix or update failing tests instead of disabling them.

Avoid TODOs in production code; if necessary, link them to a ticket/issue reference.---
