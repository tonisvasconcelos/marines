Title: React Best Practices (Global)

Content:
When generating or editing React code, ALWAYS follow these rules:

1. Components & structure
- Prefer FUNCTIONAL components and React hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo) instead of class components.
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g. ShipList, PortCallCard).
- Use camelCase for variables, functions and hooks (e.g. fetchVessels, usePortCalls).

2. Imports & file structure
- Group imports in this order:
  1) Built-in and third-party libraries (react, react-router, axios, etc.)
  2) Internal modules (utils, services, hooks)
  3) Components
  4) Styles
- Prefer feature-based folders (e.g. src/features/portcalls, src/features/vessels) with subfolders for components, hooks and services.

3. Hooks & logic reuse
- Extract repeated stateful logic into CUSTOM HOOKS (e.g. usePortCalls, useVesselSearch).
- Hooks live under hooks/ inside the feature folder.
- Avoid putting side effects directly in render logic; use useEffect/useMemo properly.

4. Clean code
- Keep components small and focused; avoid deeply nested JSX.
- Use prop destructuring and meaningful prop names.
- Follow DRY: if UI or logic repeats, extract a component or hook.
