Follow the existing styling approach (CSS modules, Tailwind, styled-components, etc.). Do not mix multiple systems without reason.

Prefer utility classes / shared styles over inline styles when possible.

Ensure responsive design: test at least mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints for new UI elements.

Avoid magic numbers in spacing and sizing; reuse existing spacing variables/scales defined in the project.

Maintain accessible contrast and legible font sizes. Do not use text smaller than the existing base size.

When introducing new colors or typography, keep them aligned with the current design tokens or theme.
