Prefer functional components with hooks over class components.

Keep components presentational vs container responsibilities separated when possible (UI vs data fetching/state).

Manage global state with the existing pattern in the repo (e.g., Context, Redux, Zustand). Do not introduce a new state library without strong justification.

Derive UI from state; avoid manual DOM manipulation (document.querySelector, etc.) except when absolutely necessary.

Keep components small: if a component grows beyond ~200 lines or has multiple responsibilities, consider splitting it.

Use controlled components for forms and propagate changes through props or context instead of mutating state in place.

Avoid prop drilling when there is already a global state or context suitable for that data.

Handle loading, empty, and error states explicitly for every async UI (spinners, skeletons, or messages).

When adding new UI, keep styling and layout consistent with the existing design system (components, spacing, colors, typography).

Prefer composition over inheritance: pass children or render props instead of adding many boolean flags.
