Always read the existing codebase and project configuration before creating new files or functions. Prefer extending existing patterns over inventing new ones.

Follow the existing architecture, naming conventions, and folder structure unless there is a clear, documented reason to refactor.

Prefer small, focused, composable functions and components over large monoliths.

Write self-documenting code with meaningful names instead of adding excessive comments.

When adding new dependencies, first check if a similar dependency already exists to avoid duplicates.

Never hard-code secrets, API keys, or credentials. Always use environment variables and existing config mechanisms.

Add or update documentation (README, comments, API docs) whenever you introduce a non-obvious behavior or new feature.
